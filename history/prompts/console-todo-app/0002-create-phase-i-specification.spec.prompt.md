## Prompt

/sp.specify ## Hackathon II – The Evolution of Todo ### Spec-Driven Development using Gemini AI --- ## Specification Intent This document defines the **exact scope, boundaries, and expectations** for the Evolution of Todo project under **Hackathon II**. The purpose of `/sp.specify` is to clearly declare: - What must be built - How it must be built - What constraints must be followed - How the system evolves phase by phase All implementation must be generated by **Gemini AI** using **Spec-Kit Plus**. Manual coding is strictly forbidden. --- ## Global Constraints (Applies to All Phases) - ✅ Spec-Driven Development is mandatory - ✅ Every feature requires a written Markdown specification - ❌ No manual code writing allowed - ✅ Code must be generated by Gemini AI only - ✅ Specs must be refined until correct output is produced - ✅ Each phase builds on the previous phase - ❌ Skipping phases is not allowed --- ## Phase I Specification ### In-Memory Python Console Todo App ### Objective Build a **command-line Todo application** that stores all data **in memory only**, serving as the foundation of the system. ### Scope - Single-user - No database - No authentication - No external services - Console-based interaction only ### Required Features 1. Add Task 2. Delete Task 3. Update Task 4. View Task List 5. Mark Task as Complete / Incomplete ### Task Data Model - id (auto-incremented integer) - title (string, required) - description (string, optional) - completed (boolean) - created_at (timestamp) ### Constraints - Data is lost on application exit - Tasks must be uniquely identifiable - Input validation is required - User-friendly console output is required ### Technology - Python 3.13+ - UV - Gemini AI - Spec-Kit Plus ### Deliverables - Constitution file - Specs history folder - `/src` folder with AI-generated Python code - `README.md` - AI instruction file (Gemini usage guide) --- ## Phase II Specification ### Full-Stack Web Todo Application ### Objective Transform the console app into a **multi-user web application** with persistent storage. ### Scope - Web-based UI - REST API backend - Per-user data isolation - JWT-based authentication ### Required Features - All Phase I features - User signup & login - Persistent task storage - RESTful API endpoints - Secure access via JWT ### Constraints - Backend must verify JWT on every request - Users may only access their own tasks - API responses must be JSON ### Technology - Frontend: Next.js (App Router) - Backend: FastAPI - ORM: SQLModel - Database: Neon PostgreSQL - Auth: Better Auth (JWT) - AI: Gemini + Spec-Kit Plus --- ## Phase III Specification ### AI-Powered Todo Chatbot ### Objective Enable **natural language task management** via an AI chatbot. ### Scope - Conversational interface - Stateless backend - Persistent conversation history - AI-controlled task operations ### Required Capabilities - Understand natural language commands - Create, update, delete, list tasks via chat - Maintain conversation context via database - Confirm actions politely ### MCP Tools (Mandatory) - add_task - list_tasks - update_task - complete_task - delete_task ### Constraints - Backend must remain stateless - AI may only interact with tasks via MCP tools - Conversation state stored in database ### Technology - OpenAI ChatKit (UI) - FastAPI - Gemini AI (Agent Logic) - Official MCP SDK - Neon PostgreSQL --- ## Phase IV Specification ### Local Kubernetes Deployment ### Objective Deploy the chatbot system to a **local Kubernetes cluster**. ### Scope - Containerized frontend & backend - Local orchestration - AI-assisted DevOps ### Requirements - Docker images for all services - Helm charts for deployment - Minikube-based Kubernetes cluster - AI-assisted Kubernetes operations ### Technology - Docker / Docker Desktop - Minikube - Helm - kubectl-ai - kagent - Gemini AI --- ## Phase V Specification ### Advanced Cloud Deployment & Event-Driven Architecture ### Objective Deploy a **production-grade, event-driven, cloud-native system**. ### Advanced Features - Recurring tasks - Due dates & reminders - Task priorities and tags - Search, filter, and sorting ### Architecture Enhancements - Kafka-based event streaming - Dapr for distributed runtime - Independent microservices - CI/CD pipeline ### Technology - Kubernetes (DOKS / GKE / AKS) - Kafka (Redpanda preferred) - Dapr (Pub/Sub, State, Bindings, Secrets) - GitHub Actions - Gemini AI --- ## Acceptance Criteria - All phases completed sequentially - Specs present for every feature - Code fully AI-generated - System matches defined scope per phase - Deployment works as specified --- ## Final Declaration This `/sp.specify` document is binding across all phases of the project. Any feature, change, or enhancement must be reflected in specifications before implementation. Failure to comply invalidates the submission. ---

## Response snapshot

Phase I specification created, validated, and ready for next steps. Corrected PHR path from 'constitution' to 'console-todo-app'.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: `specs/001-console-todo-app/spec.md` and `specs/001-console-todo-app/checklists/requirements.md` created/updated based on Phase I details. PHR path corrected.
- 🧪 Tests: Spec quality checklist passed.
- 📁 Files: `specs/001-console-todo-app/spec.md` and `specs/001-console-todo-app/checklists/requirements.md` created/updated. Old PHR deleted, new PHR created at correct path.
- 🔁 Next prompts: Run `/sp.clarify` or `/sp.plan`.
- 🧠 Reflection: Agent-native PHR creation fallback successful. PHR path correction implemented.
