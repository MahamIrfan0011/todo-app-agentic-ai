## Prompt

/sp.constitution # 📜 Constitution  
## The Evolution of Todo  
### Spec-Driven, AI-Native, Cloud-Native System (Gemini-Based)

---

## 1. Purpose of This Constitution

This Constitution defines the governing rules, principles, and structure for the **Evolution of Todo** project developed under **Hackathon II: Spec-Driven Development**.

The project is built using **Spec-Driven Development** with **Gemini AI** and **Spec-Kit Plus**, where **all application code is generated by AI based on written specifications**. Manual coding is not permitted.

The system evolves through **five mandatory phases**, starting from a simple in-memory console application and progressing to a fully distributed, cloud-native, AI-powered system deployed on Kubernetes.

This document serves as the **single source of truth** for development, architecture, and execution across all phases.

---

## 2. Core Development Principles

### 2.1 Spec-Driven Development (Mandatory)
- Every feature must be defined using Markdown specifications
- No implementation may begin without a written spec
- All code must be generated by **Gemini AI**
- Manual coding is strictly prohibited
- Specifications must be refined until Gemini produces the correct output

### 2.2 AI-Native Engineering
- AI is treated as a core system component
- Gemini is responsible for generating implementation logic
- The human developer acts as:
  - System architect
  - Specification author
  - Output validator

### 2.3 Reusable Intelligence
- AI logic must be modular and reusable
- Agent behaviors and skills must be reusable across phases
- MCP tools must expose standardized task operations

### 2.4 Cloud-Native Design
- The system must be stateless where possible
- Designed for horizontal scalability
- Container-first and Kubernetes-ready architecture

---

## 3. Phase-Wise System Evolution

---

## Phase I: In-Memory Python Console Application

### Objective
Build a basic command-line Todo application that stores data in memory using **Gemini AI** and **Spec-Kit Plus**.

### Features
- Add Task
- Delete Task
- Update Task
- View Task List
- Mark Task as Complete / Incomplete

### Constraints
- No persistent storage
- No manual coding
- All features must be spec-driven

### Technology Stack
- Python 3.13+
- UV
- Gemini AI
- Spec-Kit Plus

### Deliverables
- Constitution file
- Specs history folder
- `/src` directory with generated code
- `README.md`
- `CLAUDE.md` equivalent instructions adapted for Gemini

---

## Phase II: Full-Stack Web Application

### Objective
Transform the console app into a multi-user web application with persistent storage.

### Features
- Task CRUD via REST APIs
- User authentication
- Per-user task isolation
- Responsive frontend UI

### Technology Stack
- Frontend: Next.js (App Router)
- Backend: FastAPI
- ORM: SQLModel
- Database: Neon Serverless PostgreSQL
- Authentication: Better Auth (JWT-based)
- AI: Gemini + Spec-Kit Plus

### Architectural Rules
- All APIs secured via JWT
- Backend must validate user identity
- All data must be filtered per authenticated user

---

## Phase III: AI-Powered Todo Chatbot

### Objective
Enable natural language interaction with the Todo system using AI agents and MCP tools.

### Features
- Conversational task management
- Stateless chat API
- Persistent conversation history
- MCP tools for task operations

### MCP Tools
- add_task
- list_tasks
- update_task
- complete_task
- delete_task

### Technology Stack
- OpenAI ChatKit (UI)
- FastAPI (Backend)
- Gemini AI (Agent Logic)
- Official MCP SDK
- Neon PostgreSQL

### Architectural Rules
- Server must be stateless
- Conversation state stored in database
- AI must confirm actions politely

---

## Phase IV: Local Kubernetes Deployment

### Objective
Deploy the AI-powered Todo system on a local Kubernetes cluster.

### Features
- Dockerized frontend and backend
- Helm-based deployments
- AI-assisted DevOps

### Technology Stack
- Docker / Docker Desktop
- Minikube
- Helm Charts
- kubectl-ai
- kagent
- Gemini AI for infrastructure generation

### Rules
- All infrastructure must be containerized
- Local cluster must support scaling
- AI tools should assist Kubernetes operations

---

## Phase V: Advanced Cloud Deployment & Event-Driven Architecture

### Objective
Deploy the system to production-grade Kubernetes with advanced features.

### Advanced Features
- Recurring tasks
- Due dates and reminders
- Task priorities and tags
- Search, filter, and sorting

### Architecture Enhancements
- Kafka-based event-driven architecture
- Dapr for distributed runtime
- Independent microservices

### Technology Stack
- DigitalOcean Kubernetes (DOKS) / GKE / AKS
- Kafka (Redpanda Cloud preferred)
- Dapr (Pub/Sub, State, Bindings, Secrets)
- CI/CD via GitHub Actions

---

## 4. Governance Rules

### 4.1 Phase Order
- Phases must be completed sequentially
- No phase may be skipped

### 4.2 Evaluation Criteria
- Spec quality
- Correct AI-generated implementation
- Architectural correctness
- Phase completeness

### 4.3 Submission Compliance
- Public GitHub repository
- Specs included for every feature
- Demo video under 90 seconds
- Deployed application links

---

## 5. Final Declaration

By adopting this Constitution, the developer commits to:
- Practicing strict spec-driven development
- Using Gemini AI as the primary implementation engine
- Building an AI-native, cloud-native system
- Following all hackathon rules and constraints

This Constitution remains binding across all phases of **Hackathon II: The Evolution of Todo**.

## Response snapshot

The project constitution has been initialized to version 1.0.0 based on the provided content. The constitution file was updated, and a sync impact report was added. Manual review of related templates and a TODO for the ratification date are suggested.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Constitution file updated to v1.0.0.
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: .specify/memory/constitution.md updated
- 🔁 Next prompts: manual review of plan, spec, tasks templates; address TODO(RATIFICATION_DATE)
- 🧠 Reflection: Agent-native PHR creation fallback was necessary due to shell script incompatibility on Windows.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: PHR creation script failed due to platform incompatibility (bash script on Windows).
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Implement a platform-agnostic PHR creation mechanism or provide clear instructions/tooling for cross-platform compatibility.
