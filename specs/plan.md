# /sp.plan  
## Hackathon II – The Evolution of Todo  
### Spec-Driven Execution Plan (Gemini AI)

---

## Purpose of This Plan

The `/sp.plan` document defines the **step-by-step execution strategy** for building **The Evolution of Todo** using **Spec-Driven Development**.

This plan ensures:
- Clear phase sequencing
- Controlled scope expansion
- AI-generated implementation via Gemini
- Continuous validation at every stage

This plan must be followed strictly.  
No phase, task, or specification may be skipped.

---

## Planning Principles

- Specifications come before implementation
- Gemini AI generates all code
- Each phase builds on verified outputs of the previous phase
- Errors are resolved by refining specs, not editing code
- Documentation evolves alongside the system

---

## Phase I Plan  
### In-Memory Python Console Application

### Goal
Establish a functional foundation with basic Todo operations using an in-memory data model.

### Execution Steps
1. Initialize repository and documentation
2. Define core data model specification
3. Write feature specs for all basic Todo operations
4. Use Gemini AI to generate Python implementation
5. Validate console behavior and user experience
6. Refine specs until output meets acceptance criteria

### Completion Criteria
- All basic features work correctly
- No persistent storage
- Clean console output
- All code generated by Gemini

---

## Phase II Plan  
### Full-Stack Web Application

### Goal
Convert the console application into a secure, multi-user web application.

### Execution Steps
1. Define monorepo and architecture specifications
2. Write database schema and migration specs
3. Specify REST API endpoints
4. Define authentication and JWT validation flow
5. Generate backend services via Gemini
6. Specify frontend UI components and pages
7. Generate frontend implementation via Gemini
8. Perform end-to-end validation

### Completion Criteria
- Authenticated users only
- Tasks isolated per user
- Persistent data storage
- Functional frontend and backend

---

## Phase III Plan  
### AI-Powered Todo Chatbot

### Goal
Enable natural language task management through an AI chatbot.

### Execution Steps
1. Define chatbot architecture and stateless flow
2. Specify MCP tools for task operations
3. Define AI agent behavior rules
4. Specify chat API request/response formats
5. Generate MCP server and agent logic via Gemini
6. Generate ChatKit-based frontend
7. Validate conversational flows and tool usage
8. Ensure conversation persistence and recovery

### Completion Criteria
- Natural language commands supported
- Stateless backend
- Persistent conversation history
- Accurate task manipulation via AI

---

## Phase IV Plan  
### Local Kubernetes Deployment

### Goal
Deploy the complete chatbot system on a local Kubernetes cluster.

### Execution Steps
1. Specify containerization requirements
2. Generate Docker images for all services
3. Define Helm charts for deployment
4. Deploy services on Minikube
5. Validate scaling and service discovery
6. Use AI-assisted tools for cluster management
7. Refine infrastructure specs if needed

### Completion Criteria
- All services running on Minikube
- Successful inter-service communication
- Scalable and restart-safe deployment

---

## Phase V Plan  
### Advanced Cloud Deployment & Event-Driven Architecture

### Goal
Transform the system into a production-grade, event-driven cloud-native platform.

### Execution Steps
1. Specify advanced Todo features
2. Define Kafka-based event architecture
3. Specify Dapr components (Pub/Sub, State, Cron, Secrets)
4. Generate microservices via Gemini
5. Deploy locally with Minikube + Dapr
6. Deploy to cloud Kubernetes (DOKS / GKE / AKS)
7. Configure CI/CD pipeline
8. Set up monitoring and logging
9. Perform full system validation

### Completion Criteria
- Advanced features operational
- Event-driven architecture active
- Cloud deployment successful
- Observability in place

---

## Risk Management Plan

- Incorrect AI output → refine specs
- Integration failures → improve interface specs
- Deployment issues → update infrastructure specs
- Scaling issues → adjust Kubernetes configurations

---

## Review & Validation Strategy

- Validate each phase independently
- Confirm specs match implementation
- Ensure AI-only code generation
- Review documentation completeness

---

## Final Declaration

This `/sp.plan` is binding for the entire project lifecycle.

Any deviation from this plan must be reflected in updated specifications before implementation continues.

Following this plan ensures successful completion of **Hackathon II – The Evolution of Todo** using **Spec-Driven Development with Gemini AI**.
